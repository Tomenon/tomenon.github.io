      <h1>SYLPHY BOT TERMS OF SERVICE</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>The Sylphy Bot ("the Bot") is owned and operated by Tomenon ("We", "Us").</p>
        <p>We reserve the right to terminate your use of the Sylphy Bot at any time and for any reason.</p>
        <p>Reasons for termination of use include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <p> 1. Using the Bot in ways that violate the Discord Terms of Service,</p>
        <p> 2. Using the Bot in ways that violate the Karuta Bot rules,</p>
        <p> 3. Automating interactions with the Bot, either with a bot or by self-botting,</p>
        <p> 4. Causing intentional strain on the Bot to impede proper performance,</p>
        <p> 5. Monetizing access to the Bot, and</p>
        <p> 6. Intentionally uploading images that are graphic, obscene, or that contain nudity to the Bot.</p>
        <p>By using the Bot, inviting the Bot to your server, or using a server that the Bot have joined, 
          you are indicating your acceptance of the Bot's Terms of Service. If you do not agree to be bound to the Bot's 
          Terms of Service, you do not have permission to use the Bot.</p>
        <p>The Sylphy Bot is not affiliated with Discord nor the Karuta Bot.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </div>
      <h1>USAGE</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>The purpose of the Sylphy Bot is to be an organized search tool and an image color palette adjustment tool for users of the Karuta Bot. 
          All information provided by the Sylphy Bot is publicly accessible to users of the Karuta Bot. 
          All information provided by the Sylphy Bot is for entertainment and informational purposes only.</p>
        <p>The purpose of the Sylphy Bot's image color palette adjustment tool is to limit the color palette of a user-provided image to a predetermined set of 64 colors.</p>
        <p>By agreeing to these Terms of Service, you are agreeing to use the information and data provided 
          by the Sylphy Bot for its intended purposes only.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </div>
      <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p><strong>All user information collected by the Sylphy Bot is accessible by any Discord user.</strong></p>
        <p>By using the Bot, inviting the Bot to your server, using a server that the Bot have joined, or in 
          some other way agreeing to the Sylphy Bot Terms of Service, you are also accepting this privacy policy and agreement. 
          This privacy policy is written to outline the kind of data that the Bot collects and stores, and also how this data is used.</p>
        <p>Data we collect:</p>
        
        <p>1. User ID: The identification number attached to all user accounts. User IDs are accessible to anyone with a 
          Discord account, and can be seen after enabling Developer Mode in the Discord settings. The Sylphy Bot stores User IDs in order to 
          identify the artists ("sketchers") of the images contained in the Sylphy Bot search library, and to retrieve the list of images previously
          uploaded by a specific user. The Sylphy Bot collects sketchers' User IDs 
          automatically from embedded messages sent by the Karuta Bot. The Sylphy Bot collects the image conversion tool's users' IDs from the users'
          messages when the user issues a command to the Sylphy Bot.</p>
        
        <p>2. Channel ID: The identification number attached to all guild channels. Channel IDs are accessible to anyone 
          with a Discord account, and can be seen after enabling Developer Mode in the Discord settings. We store Channel IDs to 
          flag specific channels as operable as a "display channel". 
          The Sylphy Bot will automatically display into flagged "display channels" any new entry to the Sylphy Bot's search library as they are 
          entered. We store Channel IDs only at the request of the Guild owner(s) for any guild to which the stored channel belongs, and they are only stored manually.</p>
        
        <p>3. Message ID: The identification number attached to all Discord messages. Message IDs are accessible to anyone 
          with a Discord account, and can be seen after enabling Developer Mode in the Discord settings. We store Message IDs for use in file names for the 
          images sent by the Sylphy Bot. Using Message IDs in file names ensures no duplicate file name occurs.

        <p>4. Message Content and Embeds: The Sylphy Bot updates its library by reading "Card" data from Karuta Bot's embedded messages. 
          The data read from these embedded messages includes "Series Names", "Character Names", "Character Aliases", "Card IDs", 
          "Print Numbers", "Edition Numbers", "Card Ink", "Card Inkwells", "Sketcher IDs", and the embedded messages' thumbnail images. 
          This data is accessible to all verified users of the Karuta Bot. This data is only obtained from the Karuta Bot's messages. 
          We analyze Message Content from the Sylphy Bot's users' messages to process text commands.
          The Sylphy Bot accesses the images attached to user commands in order to analyze the image and reduce the color palette of the image.
          The original image sent by the user and the resulting "converted" image are both stored by the Sylphy Bot and can be deleted by the user at any time.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We do not sell or share any collected data with any third parties.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </div>
      <h1>DATA DELETION</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Users may request at any time for us to remove their User ID or Channel IDs by joining the support server linked in the Sylphy Bot's profile. 
          However, all User IDs stored in the Sylphy Bot are collected from the Karuta Bot's messages, not from the users themselves. Unless a user first 
          requests their data deletion from the Karuta Bot, removing their data from the Sylphy Bot will only temporarily remove their User ID, and the User ID 
          is at risk of being recorded again unless the user requests data deletion from the Karuta Bot first. Users have access through the Bot's commands to
          delete any of the stored images they have uploaded to the Bot through the image color palette adjustment tool.</p>
